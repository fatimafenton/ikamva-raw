		<h1>Welcome to Ikamva Ubomi</h1>
		<article>
		Ikamva Ubomi is a community based outreach NPO established in December 2011 that aims to: empower kids with employable skills, teach kids a sense of community development, prevent crime, and most importantly give kids direction and opportunity.<br>
		<br>
        Ikamva Ubomi finds projects in communities around Cape Town where our youth can use their newly acquired skills to make a difference. They are taught to give back to the communities that they came from. We actively do projects in pensioners, churches, mosques, schools, etc., that are in need of maintenance or repair. Ikamva Ubomi also uses the help of skilled parents from local communities to teach our youth the basic skills necessary to work on these projects and make an impact. Small businesses assist us by providing finances, tools and other resources needed to complete our projects

			The library is a huge inspiration to many of our learners. There were about 41-45 learners in a class, and the library has 6 workstations and 5 tables but we were able to accommodate them in the library, but some of the leaners had to sit on the mat. They also enjoyed doing their research for their tasks, but they were unable to print any of the information found because the library does not have a printer.The library has tables and chairs but with such large amounts of learners in a class more tables and chairs and computers would be greatly appreciated then everyone in class would have computer access and equipping the learners with research techniques would be easier. There are approximately 400 ~Chanice Visagie
